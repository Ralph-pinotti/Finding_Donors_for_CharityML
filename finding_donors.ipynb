    "## Getting Started\n",
    "\n",
    "In this project, you will employ several supervised algorithms of your choice to accurately model individuals' income using data collected from the 1994 U.S. Census. You will then choose the best candidate algorithm from preliminary results and further optimize this algorithm to best model the data. Your goal with this implementation is to construct a model that accurately predicts whether an individual makes more than $50,000. This sort of task can arise in a non-profit setting, where organizations survive on donations.  Understanding an individual's income can help a non-profit better understand how large of a donation to request, or whether or not they should reach out to begin with.  While it can be difficult to determine an individual's general income bracket directly from public sources, we can (as we will see) infer this value from other publically available features. \n",
    "\n",
    "The dataset for this project originates from the [UCI Machine Learning Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Census+Income). The datset was donated by Ron Kohavi and Barry Becker, after being published in the article _\"Scaling Up the Accuracy of Naive-Bayes Classifiers: A Decision-Tree Hybrid\"_. You can find the article by Ron Kohavi [online](https://www.aaai.org/Papers/KDD/1996/KDD96-033.pdf). The data we investigate here consists of small changes to the original dataset, such as removing the `'fnlwgt'` feature and records with missing or ill-formatted entries."

    "## Preparing the Data\n",
    "Before data can be used as input for machine learning algorithms, it often must be cleaned, formatted, and restructured — this is typically known as **preprocessing**. Fortunately, for this dataset, there are no invalid or missing entries we must deal with, however, there are some qualities about certain features that must be adjusted. This preprocessing can help tremendously with the outcome and predictive power of nearly all learning algorithms."

    "A dataset may sometimes contain at least one feature whose values tend to lie near a single number, but will also have a non-trivial number of vastly larger or smaller values than that single number.  Algorithms can be sensitive to such distributions of values and can underperform if the range is not properly normalized. With the census dataset two features fit this description: '`capital-gain'` and `'capital-loss'`. \n",

Using a logarithmic transformation significantly reduces the range of values caused by outliers. Care must be taken when applying this transformation however: The logarithm of `0` is undefined, so we must translate the values by a small amount above `0` to apply the the logarithm successfully.\n",

    "### Normalizing Numerical Features\n",
    "In addition to performing transformations on features that are highly skewed, it is often good practice to perform some type of scaling on numerical features. Applying a scaling to the data does not change the shape of each feature's distribution (such as `'capital-gain'` or `'capital-loss'` above); however, normalization ensures that each feature is treated equally when applying supervised learners. Note that once scaling is applied, observing the data in its raw form will no longer have the same original meaning, as exampled below.\n",
    "\n",
    "Run the code cell below to normalize each numerical feature. We will use [`sklearn.preprocessing.MinMaxScaler`](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.preprocessing.MinMaxScaler.html) for this."

    "From the table in **Exploring the Data** above, we can see there are several features for each record that are non-numeric. Typically, learning algorithms expect input to be numeric, which requires that non-numeric features (called *categorical variables*) be converted. One popular way to convert categorical variables is by using the **one-hot encoding** scheme. One-hot encoding creates a _\"dummy\"_ variable for each possible category of each non-numeric feature. For example, assume `someFeature` has three possible entries: `A`, `B`, or `C`. We then encode this feature into `someFeature_A`, `someFeature_B` and `someFeature_C`.\n",
    "\n",
    "|   | someFeature |                    | someFeature_A | someFeature_B | someFeature_C |\n",
    "| :-: | :-: |                            | :-: | :-: | :-: |\n",
    "| 0 |  B  |  | 0 | 1 | 0 |\n",
    "| 1 |  C  | ----> one-hot encode ----> | 0 | 0 | 1 |\n",
    "| 2 |  A  |  | 1 | 0 | 0 |\n",
    "\n",
    "Additionally, as with the non-numeric features, we need to convert the non-numeric target label, `'income'` to numerical values for the learning algorithm to work. Since there are only two possible categories for this label (\"<=50K\" and \">50K\"), we can avoid using one-hot encoding and simply encode these two categories as `0` and `1`, respectively. In code cell below, you will need to implement the following:\n",
    " - Use [`pandas.get_dummies()`](http://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/generated/pandas.get_dummies.html?highlight=get_dummies#pandas.get_dummies) to perform one-hot encoding on the `'features_raw'` data.\n",
    " - Convert the target label `'income_raw'` to numerical entries.\n",
    "   - Set records with \"<=50K\" to `0` and records with \">50K\" to `1`."

    "### Metrics and the Naive Predictor\n",
    "*CharityML*, equipped with their research, knows individuals that make more than \\$50,000 are most likely to donate to their charity. Because of this, *CharityML* is particularly interested in predicting who makes more than \\$50,000 accurately. It would seem that using **accuracy** as a metric for evaluating a particular model's performace would be appropriate. Additionally, identifying someone that *does not* make more than \\$50,000 as someone who does would be detrimental to *CharityML*, since they are looking to find individuals willing to donate. Therefore, a model's ability to precisely predict those that make more than \\$50,000 is *more important* than the model's ability to **recall** those individuals. We can use **F-beta score** as a metric that considers both precision and recall:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ F_{\\beta} = (1 + \\beta^2) \\cdot \\frac{precision \\cdot recall}{\\left( \\beta^2 \\cdot precision \\right) + recall} $$\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "In particular, when $\\beta = 0.5$, more emphasis is placed on precision. This is called the **F$_{0.5}$ score** (or F-score for simplicity).\n",
    "\n",
    "Looking at the distribution of classes (those who make at most \\$50,000, and those who make more), it's clear most individuals do not make more than \\$50,000. This can greatly affect **accuracy**, since we could simply say *\"this person does not make more than \\$50,000\"* and generally be right, without ever looking at the data! Making such a statement would be called **naive**, since we have not considered any information to substantiate the claim. It is always important to consider the *naive prediction* for your data, to help establish a benchmark for whether a model is performing well. That been said, using that prediction would be pointless: If we predicted all people made less than \\$50,000, *CharityML* would identify no one as donors. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Note: Recap of accuracy, precision, recall\n",
    "\n",
    "** Accuracy ** measures how often the classifier makes the correct prediction. It’s the ratio of the number of correct predictions to the total number of predictions (the number of test data points).\n",
    "\n",
    "** Precision ** tells us what proportion of messages we classified as spam, actually were spam.\n",
    "It is a ratio of true positives(words classified as spam, and which are actually spam) to all positives(all words classified as spam, irrespective of whether that was the correct classificatio), in other words it is the ratio of\n",
    "\n",
    "`[True Positives/(True Positives + False Positives)]`\n",
    "\n",
    "** Recall(sensitivity)** tells us what proportion of messages that actually were spam were classified by us as spam.\n",
    "It is a ratio of true positives(words classified as spam, and which are actually spam) to all the words that were actually spam, in other words it is the ratio of\n",
    "\n",
    "`[True Positives/(True Positives + False Negatives)]`\n",
    "\n",
    "For classification problems that are skewed in their classification distributions like in our case, for example if we had a 100 text messages and only 2 were spam and the rest 98 weren't, accuracy by itself is not a very good metric. We could classify 90 messages as not spam(including the 2 that were spam but we classify them as not spam, hence they would be false negatives) and 10 as spam(all 10 false positives) and still get a reasonably good accuracy score. For such cases, precision and recall come in very handy. These two metrics can be combined to get the F1 score, which is weighted average(harmonic mean) of the precision and recall scores. This score can range from 0 to 1, with 1 being the best possible F1 score(we take the harmonic mean as we are dealing with ratios)."

    "\n",
    "- Id3 is a descision tree algorithm that is used in business today. This algorithm helps companies and managers to define an optimal target public based on rules created by previous learning. This technique can be applyed in e-mail market campaigns to find the public that has the ablity to convert in any purchase or even in a public selection to offer a credit. The algorithm creates a multiway tree, finding for each node (i.e. in a greedy manner) the categorical feature that will yield the largest information gain for categorical targets. (http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/tree.html)\n",
    "\n",
    "- This kind of algorithm has strengths in the interpretation because the results are visible in the tree structure (white box), it leaves the business easier to interpret while other algorithm are not easy to explain like neural network that are called black box. In small dataset, the algorithm is very fast to learn and other datas can be classified by the learned rules. Also it can learn any non-linear relationship between the atributes and is able to handle multi-output problems.\n",
    "\n",
    "- One of the weakness of Id3 is that data can be over-fitted if a small sample is tested and a pruned mode is not used. It also can over-fit when large number of features are used. In some case, continuos data should be avoided because it can take a long time to process and can have a high use of memory.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Id3 is a good candidate to test on the census data. We have around 45,000 records and the algorithm can run very fast. We can tune the decision tree using Random Forest that can run several decision trees in parallel and avoid some cases of overfitting. The decision tree is able to handle both numerical and categorical data, that is how the data is composed while other techniques are usually specialised in analysing datasets that have only one type of variable.The rsult are also validate using statistical tests. That makes it possible to account for the reliability of the model.(http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/tree.html#tree)\n",

In business, it can be used in a credit card customer churn analysis to provide a model with better classification.\n",
    "\n",
    "- The SVM work really well in complicated domains where there is a clear margin of separation in the data.To correctly classify the data, svm can define higher complex order separation planes through custom kernels, working in a effective way in high dimensional spaces.\n",
    "\n",
    "- This classifyer doesn't perform in large datasets because the training time can be very costly. They also don't work well in a noise data, when the data is overlapping alot, svm needs to count independent evidences avoiding Naive Bays from being better in this case.\n",
    "\n",
    "- SVM is a good candidate because 45000 records are good enouth to have a good performance mainly with a clear distinct target variable (more than 50K or less then 50K). The data have a high number of features after one hot encoding, so the SVM could not perform very well because it requires matrix inversion\n",

    "\n",
    "- It can be used in conjunction with many other types of learning algorithms to improve performance including decision tree. It works by merging several weaks of outputs on the repeatedly modified versions of the data to gernerate an effective classification. The boost method gives extra weight for individual data that had an early unsucessful classification to pay more attention in the next processing.\n",
    "\n",
    "- AdaBoost is sensitive to noisy data and outliers but in this case de data is clean. In some problems it can be less susceptible to the overfitting problem than other learning algorithms. If a complex model is used as the base classifier, this can lead to overfitting to the training data.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Adaboost is a good candidate because our data is already clear and is quite large for this method, that also avoid overfitting by limiting how many times they can subdivide and how few data points are allowed in each region. The algorithm constructs a sequence of trees, each of which learns to compensate for the error left by the tree before. The result is a very accurate learner that tends to use a lot of memory (https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/machine-learning/studio/algorithm-choice)\n",

In order to  reach this conclusion, three algorithms were used to classify the same dataset and each result was compared between the classifiers to optimize the acuraccy and fscore. I used the decision tree classifier, Adaboost Ensemble Method and SVM.\n",
    "We can observe from the plots, in comparison to SVC, the Adaboost was able to train the data and predict the results very quickly. The speed of the training and test can be compared with the decision tree that is  faster then SVM. The speedy performance's keep the same in different training set sizes and for 45,000 records. If we increase our dataset, SVM tends to be impracticable.\n",
    "As we look to accuracy graphs we can see the decision tree classifier geting 100 per cent in the accuracy score and peerformance poorly in test data set, showing us that this classifier decorated the rules and didn't generalize well. Looking to the Adaboost, it performance is significantly higher then the others in the training data in terms of the Fbeta score. Adaboost slightly outperforms SVC and Decision tree at all training set sizes.\n",
    "The algoritm works very well when the number of data sets increases. We can see in \"Accuracy Score on Testing Set\" Graph that higher is the training set higher is the accuracy score. The same rules happens to \"Fscore on testing Set\" graph.\n",

This model performed well in test and training dataset quickly then the others classifier. In this case we are able to use the full dataset to best performance the results because the time of processing the test and training set is irrelevant"

    "The Adaboost woks on training set selection as followns:\n",
    "Each weak classifier should be trained on a random subset of the total training set. AdaBoost give a “weight” to each training example, which determines the probability that each example should appear in the training set. Examples with higher weights are more likely to be included in the training set, and vice versa. After training a classifier, AdaBoost increases the weight on the misclassified examples so that these examples will make up a larger part of the next classifiers training (http://mccormickml.com/2013/12/13/adaboost-tutorial/)\n",
    "\n",
    "After each classifier is trained, the classifier’s weight is calculated based on its accuracy. More accurate classifiers are given more weight. A classifier with 50% accuracy is given a weight of zero, and a classifier with less than 50% accuracy (kind of a funny concept) is given negative weight.\n",

    ">>With the optimize model, our result have a slight increase compared to the unoptimized model. The increase happened because the process combined the parameters that were passed as arguments to the constructor of the estimator classes. The use of the grid search, exhaustive search over specified parameter values for an estimator. The parameters selected were those that maximize the score of the dataset, unless an explicit score is passed, in case wich it is used instead. In this case, the results of the optimized model is better than the unoptimized one. Some question should be taken in consideration: First at all I don't have problems with machine memory with this amount of records (around 45,000) and the models that were selected. Second, the time of processing are acceptable to do this work. As the result is better and the condition mentioned before are acceptable, I can consider the optimized model as better than the unoptimized. In case of machine memory problem we could chose the unoptimized model because they are similar, but smaller, to the optimized problem. Comparing the results with the Benchmark, we found a great different between then, the optimized model is around 3 times better in accuracy and F-score."

    "How does a model perform if we only use a subset of all the available features in the data? With less features required to train, the expectation is that training and prediction time is much lower — at the cost of performance metrics. From the visualization above, we see that the top five most important features contribute more than half of the importance of **all** features present in the data. This hints that we can attempt to *reduce the feature space* and simplify the information required for the model to learn.

    "The result of accuracy and fscore of the final model that was trained on reduced data is slightly smaller than the model that was trained on full data, but this difference is acceptable when we face timing process problem (in case of records increase). The difference in F-score is bigger then the Accuracy and I thin it happens because the model cannot learn the complexity of the data when is running on reduced data.\n",
